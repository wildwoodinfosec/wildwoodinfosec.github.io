## Penetration Testing

### Web Application & API Testing
- Authentication/authorization and session management
- Business logic and workflow abuse
- Data exposure and injection classes
- OWASP-aligned testing with real exploitability focus

### Cloud Security Testing
- Identity and access review (IAM)
- Storage exposure and permissions
- Network segmentation and misconfiguration
- Privilege escalation paths

### Network Penetration Testing
- External perimeter assessment
- Internal network testing and lateral movement paths
- Misconfiguration and credential exposure
- Defensive control validation (MFA, logging, EDR visibility)

## Engagement Options

### Fixed-scope Assessment
Best for time-boxed testing on defined systems.

### Iterative / Retainer Model
Ongoing testing cadence for teams shipping continuously.

### Custom Engagement
If you have a specific threat model, compliance need, or target environment, we will build the scope around that.
